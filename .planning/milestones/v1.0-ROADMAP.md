# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-10
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 5 phases (built in single execution cycle)

## Overview

This roadmap delivered a hierarchical task management app in five phases. We started with project scaffolding, database schema, and theme foundation, then built the organizational structure (workspaces, projects, sections) with sidebar navigation. Next came the core task engine (tasks, subtasks, tags, cascade deletes). With data and mutations in place, we built the two project views (list and board) with styled task cards. Finally, we added smart views (Today, Completed, Search, Tags), the quick-add modal, live task counts, and quality gate tests.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: A running Next.js app with the full database schema, theme tokens, and tooling so every subsequent phase builds on solid infrastructure
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: DATA-01, DATA-02, STYLE-01, STYLE-02, QUAL-01, QUAL-02, QUAL-03
**Status**: COMPLETED 2026-02-10

**Success Criteria** (all TRUE):
  1. Running `npm run dev` serves a Next.js app at localhost with the navy/gold/beige theme visible
  2. Prisma schema defines all models (Workspace, Project, Section, Task, Tag, TaskTag) with correct relations and db push succeeds against Postgres
  3. Biome lint passes, TypeScript compiles without errors, and `npm run build` succeeds
  4. Theme CSS variables match dan-weinbeck.com tokens (navy, gold, beige palette) and all three font families load correctly

### Phase 2: Organization & Navigation

**Goal**: Users can create and manage workspaces, projects, and sections, and navigate between them via a persistent sidebar
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: ORG-01, ORG-02, ORG-03, ORG-04, ORG-05, NAV-01, NAV-02, NAV-05
**Status**: COMPLETED 2026-02-10

**Success Criteria** (all TRUE):
  1. User can create, rename, and delete workspaces, and these persist after page refresh
  2. User can create, rename, and delete projects within a workspace, and create, rename, delete sections within a project
  3. Sidebar displays the workspace-to-project tree and smart view links (Search, Today, Completed, Filters & Tags), and remains visible across all page navigations
  4. Clicking a project in the sidebar navigates to that project's page

### Phase 3: Task Engine

**Goal**: Users can fully manage tasks (create, edit, delete, complete, assign, order), create subtasks with enforced one-level nesting, manage tags, and cascade-delete parent entities
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: TASK-01, TASK-02, TASK-03, TASK-04, TASK-05, TASK-06, TASK-07, SUB-01, SUB-02, SUB-03, SUB-04, TAG-01, TAG-02, TAG-03, DATA-03
**Status**: COMPLETED 2026-02-10

**Success Criteria** (all TRUE):
  1. User can create a task with name, description, deadline, and tags; edit all fields; delete with confirmation; and toggle between OPEN and COMPLETED status
  2. User can assign a task to a section via form, and tasks maintain order within their section or project
  3. User can add subtasks to a task, and attempting to add a subtask to a subtask is blocked with a clear error message
  4. User can create tags with name and color, assign multiple tags to a task, and remove tags from a task
  5. Deleting a workspace, project, or section shows a confirmation dialog and cascades deletion to all children

### Phase 4: Project Views

**Goal**: Users can view their project's tasks in both list and board layouts with styled, expandable task cards
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: VIEW-01, VIEW-02, VIEW-03, VIEW-04, VIEW-05, VIEW-06, VIEW-07, STYLE-03
**Status**: COMPLETED 2026-02-10

**Success Criteria** (all TRUE):
  1. Project list view displays tasks grouped by section, and project board view displays sections as columns with task cards
  2. User can toggle between list and board view on any project, and the selected view persists
  3. Board view allows adding a new section as a column directly from the board
  4. Task cards show name, due date, tags, and completion toggle; clicking a card expands it to reveal description and subtasks
  5. Task cards use the dan-weinbeck.com card pattern (rounded-2xl, shadow, hover lift animation)

### Phase 5: Smart Views & Polish

**Goal**: Users can find and filter tasks across projects using Today, Completed, Search, and Tag views, quickly add tasks from anywhere, and all quality gates pass
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: SMART-01, SMART-02, SMART-03, SMART-04, NAV-03, NAV-04, TAG-04, QUAL-04
**Status**: COMPLETED 2026-02-10

**Success Criteria** (all TRUE):
  1. Today view shows all tasks with a deadline matching today's date (respecting browser timezone)
  2. Completed view shows all completed tasks and can be filtered by project
  3. Search finds tasks by name or description text, and Filters & Tags view lists all tags with click-to-filter
  4. Add Task button in the sidebar opens a modal for quick task creation from any page, and each project in the sidebar shows its open-task count
  5. Unit tests pass for subtask nesting constraint enforcement and Today filter date logic

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Standalone app (not embedded in personal-brand) — keeps concerns separate, own DB, independent deploy
- Postgres + Prisma 7 — production-ready, type-safe ORM, standard for Next.js
- Replicate theme tokens (not import) — standalone app copies CSS variables from dan-weinbeck.com
- Biome + Vitest — match personal-brand tooling for consistency
- No component library — custom components with Tailwind, matching personal-brand approach
- One-level subtask nesting — simplicity, enforced in app logic not DB constraint
- Prisma singleton pattern — avoids connection pool exhaustion in dev
- Fractional indexing — for section/task ordering

**Issues Resolved:**
- Prisma 7 client import path resolved (`@/generated/prisma/client`)
- Zod v4 error access pattern resolved (`.issues[0].message`)
- Biome 2.3 CSS parser configuration for Tailwind directives

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- No drag-and-drop reordering (menu-based section assignment only)
- No phase-level SUMMARY.md execution history (built outside GSD execute workflow)
